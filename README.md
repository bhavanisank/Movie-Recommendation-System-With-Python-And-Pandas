# Movie-Recommendation-System-With-Python-And-Pandas
This project recommends you the top 10 movies which similar users who have watched this movie also likes.

# Datasets Used
  *Movies.csv
  
  *ratings.csv


# Steps in This Project
 *Reading in our movie data with pandas
 
 *Cleaning movie titles with regex

*Creating a tfidf matrix

*Creating a search function

*Building an interactive search box with Jupyter

*Reading in movie ratings data

*Finding users who liked the same movie

*Finding how much all users like movies

*Creating a recommendation score

*Building a recommendation function

*Creating an interactive recommendation widget

# Concepts Used
The two basic concepts used in this recommendation system are Term frequency- Inverse Document frequency(TF-IDF) and Cosine Similarity. TF-IDF is used for the vectorization of the data and cosine similarity is used to compute the similarity measure between the vectors.

In this project i have come across lerning ipywidgets which can take input and shows output their itself in the juypter notebook.

# Summary
This project takes movie name as input from the user and recommends him the top 10 movies based upon the ratings of the similar users who have watched this movie.
